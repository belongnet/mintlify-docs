JavaScript SDK for integrating with Belong.net widget for seamless payment implementation on your website or application frontend.

## Installation

#### NPM:

You can install using npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @belongnet/sdk

# or
npm install @belongnet/sdk

# or
yarn add @belongnet/sdk
```

and then import it in your project:

```ts
import { createPaymentFrame } from "@belongnet/sdk";
```

#### CDN:

add to the bottom of your HTML file with the following content.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { createPaymentFrame } from "https://esm.sh/@belongnet/sdk";
</script>
```

#### Usage:

Use in your project:

Payment page:

```ts
createPaymentFrame({
  el: document.getElementById("belong-payment-frame"),
  params: {
    target: "event-ticket",
    eventId: "f9b2ea4c7be71407fcb6ed2c",
  },
});
```

Checkout:

````ts
createPaymentFrame({
  el: document.getElementById('belong-payment-frame'),
  params: {
    checkoutId: '672174e1ae0c81f7e40bada3',
  },
})

<Note>To create a product collection, follow the following [instructions](/app/collection/product)</Note>

## Advanced Usage

### Event listeners:

To determine the outcome of a payment (success or failure and etc), you can set up event listeners that listen to events from the payment frame.
We provide `isPaymentEvent` utility to help identify payment-related events.

```ts
import { isPaymentEvent } from '@belongnet/sdk'

function handlePayment(e: MessageEvent) {
  if (isPaymentEvent(e)) {
    switch (e.data.type) {
      case 'payment-success':
        // logic for successful payment
        console.log('payment-success', e.data.payload.link)
        break
      case 'payment-error':
        // logic for payment error
        console.log('payment-error', e.data.payload)
        break
    }
  }
}

// Add the event listener to listen for messages from the payment frame:
window.addEventListener('message', handlePayment)

// Remove the event listener when it is no longer needed to avoid potential memory leaks
function onUnmount() {
  window.removeEventListener('message', handlePayment)
}
````

This method makes sure your app reacts well to payment events, giving users a smooth experience even if payments fail. But it's only for showing visual changes on the frontend. For safer payments, you need server-side processing with the API too.
